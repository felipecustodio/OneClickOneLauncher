# Exe Generation Decoupling - Summary

## Problem Statement
The original OneLauncher executable generation process bundled the entire OneLauncher application, resulting in:
- Large executable size (50+ MB)
- Download errors during patching
- Complex dependency management
- Slow build times

## Solution Overview
Created a new `oneclick_launcher/` directory containing a completely decoupled Python project that:
- Contains only the essential patch and launch functionality
- Has minimal dependencies (platformdirs, defusedxml, httpx)
- Generates a much smaller executable (~7.3 MB)
- Maintains full compatibility with existing OneLauncher configurations

## Key Benefits
- **85% size reduction**: From 50+ MB to 7.3 MB
- **Improved reliability**: Simplified codebase reduces download errors
- **Faster builds**: Reduced complexity for CI/CD
- **Maintained compatibility**: Still reads OneLauncher configs
- **Flexible usage**: Command-line options for manual configuration

## Technical Implementation

### New Project Structure
```
oneclick_launcher/
├── standalone_patch_and_launch.py  # Main script (all-in-one)
├── standalone.spec                 # PyInstaller configuration
├── run_patch_client/              # Windows patch client runner
├── pyproject.toml                 # Project configuration
├── README.md                      # Project documentation
└── DECOUPLING.md                  # Technical details
```

### Key Features
1. **Configuration Detection**: Automatically finds OneLauncher config files
2. **Fallback Options**: Command-line arguments when config not available
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with informative messages
4. **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, Linux (for development/testing)
5. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging to file and console

### Dependencies Reduced
- **Before**: Full OneLauncher stack (PySide6, zeep, cattrs, attrs, etc.)
- **After**: Only platformdirs, defusedxml, httpx

### Build Process
- **Before**: `pyinstaller patch_and_launch.spec` (bundled everything)
- **After**: `cd oneclick_launcher && pyinstaller standalone.spec` (minimal bundle)

## Migration Path
1. Original files marked as deprecated with clear migration notes
2. New GitHub workflow `build-oneclick-decoupled.yml` created
3. Documentation provided for transition
4. Backward compatibility maintained

## Testing Results
- ✅ Executable builds successfully
- ✅ Size reduced from 50+ MB to 7.3 MB
- ✅ Command-line interface works correctly
- ✅ Error handling improved
- ✅ OneLauncher config detection functional
- ✅ Manual directory specification works

## Next Steps
1. Update main GitHub workflow to use new decoupled build
2. Monitor executable performance in production
3. Eventually remove deprecated files after transition period
